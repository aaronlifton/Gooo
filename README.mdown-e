# Gooo

This is a modular web framework for the [Go language](http://www.golang.org).



## Philosophy
> "Go on Rails (Without the Rails)"

Modular architecture
* model
* template
  * parses templates in "tmpl/" folder and defines how they are rendered
* view
  * handles routes
  * fetches rows from database as [Model](about:blank) interfaces
* conversion
  * everything in Go descends from the interface type (essentially)
  * to ease interaction with templates and databases, they must be converted
    to and from the interface{} and []interface{} types
  * Interface -> JSON
  * Interface -> Struct
  * []interface{} -> map[string]interface{}
  * GetStructValues
  * StructName: gets name of a []interface{} type
* util
  * generic error handling
